Escape is a text-based adventure game. The objective is to escape from the house. The user tries to navigate through the house and acquire anything needed to ESCAPE!

We are using a modular implementation. This would allow us to create new layouts and entirely new levels for the user to explore. The current level is a house but we could easily change it to be a school, dungeon, hospital, etc.
